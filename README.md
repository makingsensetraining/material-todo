material-seed
=============

A seed for projects using AngularJS and Material Design

Who is this for?
================

Do you want a start point to start playing with Material Design components? This project gives you that!
This is a simple AngularJS application with all the necessary infrastructure so that you can simply jump into adding components and testing them.
The application provides you with a single page called "Client Details" where you will see some simple information about a fictitious client. Feel free to grab this and modify it at will.

How do I run it?
================
VERY simple. Clone/Fork/Download...whatever you prefer.
Then, inside the app folder, you will see a server.bat file. Simply execute this file (Windows) and it will fire a simple NodeJS server that will serve the page in http://localhost:8000.
If you are a Linux user, you can simply run 'npm start' from the app folder.
Please take into consideration that you need NodeJS installed in your computer for this to run.
